COMPREHENSIVE FIX - General Industry Content Generator
FIXED: Role-competency focused topic generation instead of narrow sustainability specialization
Addresses Critical T3.2/T3.4 Compliance Gaps:
- Complete role coverage (10 roles including SBA)
- Work-based learning integration
- EQF 4-8 full support
- Micro-credential framework
- SME-specific pathways
- Enhanced ESG/Data skills focus
- FIXED: Missing sections 8, 9, 10 generation
- FIXED: Narrow specialization problem - now emphasizes ROLE COMPETENCIES
- FIXED: Method signature mismatch - get_all_competency_mappings now accepts role_id and eqf_level
