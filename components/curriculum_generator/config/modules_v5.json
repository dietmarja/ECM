Participants will learn to design digital products and services using circular principles, implement lifecycle thinking, optimize resource utilization, and create closed-loop digital ecosystems. The module covers circular design methodologies, material flow analysis, digital product lifecycle management, and circular business models. Emphasis is placed on practical application of circular economy principles to reduce waste, extend product lifecycles, and create sustainable value chains in digital contexts.",
