  "extended_description": "This advanced learning unit teaches participants to design and implement comprehensive cybersecurity frameworks specifically tailored for sustainable digital systems and environmental monitoring infrastructure. Participants will learn to secure IoT networks in sustainability contexts, implement privacy-preserving analytics for environmental data, and develop resilient cyber-physical systems for smart grids and environmental monitoring. The learning unit covers security considerations for distributed sustainability monitoring systems, threat modeling for green infrastructure, secure data transmission protocols for environmental sensors, and incident response procedures for sustainable system breaches. Through hands-on security implementation projects and vulnerability assessment exercises, learners will develop competency in creating secure, resilient sustainable systems that protect both environmental data integrity and system availability while maintaining energy efficiency and sustainability performance objectives.",
